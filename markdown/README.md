## Workshop 4

## Emphasis

Opal is a (_SiO2Â·nH2O_); its water content may range from 3% to 21% by weight, but is usually between 6% and 10%. Due to the amorphous (_chemical_) physical structure, it is classified as a mineraloid, unlike crystalline forms of silica, which are considered minerals. It is deposited at a relatively low temperature and may occur in the fissures of almost any kind of rock, being most commonly found with limonite, sandstone, rhyolite, marl, and basalt.

## strong

There are two broad classes of opal: precious and common. Precious opal displays play-of-color (iridescence); common opal does not. Play-of-color is defined as "**a pseudo chromatic optical effect resulting in flashes of colored light from certain minerals, as they are turned in white light.**" The internal structure of precious opal causes it to diffract light, resulting in play-of-color. Depending on the conditions in which it formed, opal may be transparent, translucent, or opaque, and the background color may be white, black, or nearly any color of the visual spectrum. Black opal is considered the **rarest**, while white, gray, and green opals are the most common.
